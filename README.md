# Android_Fuel_Calculator
A fuel calculator that has the functionality to calculate fuel consumption, convert from one consumption metric to another and to calculate the cost of a trip.
## About The Project
This is a personal project the idea for it popped up as i was using an online fuel calculator to calculate the consumption of my car. The application supports the four most common consumption metrics (L/100, Km/L, UK MPG, US MPG). The application has additional functionalities to convert from a given unit to the other 3 and to calculate the expected cost of a trip based on the distance, cost of fuel and the expected consumption by the driver.
## Installation
Clone the repo and open it whit android studio.
 ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/RosenStefanov/Android_Fuel_Calculator.git
  ```
## Usage
### On Start
The project starts by opening a menu in which the user chooses which functionality of the 3 provided they want to use.

### After Choosing Consumption Unit
After the user chooses a unit a calculator will be shown based on the functionality they have chosen. The consumption calculator shows 2 input fields in which the user inputs the fuel spent and the distance traveled and after the "Calculate" button is pressed the average consumption is shown. The consumption converter shows an input field in which the user inputs the consumption amount and after the "Convert" button is pressed the consumption is shown in the other 3 unit types. The trip cost calculator shows 3 input fields in which the user inputs the expected consumption, the distance traveled and the cost of fuel per unit, after the "Calculate Cost" button is pressed the cost of the trip is shown.
